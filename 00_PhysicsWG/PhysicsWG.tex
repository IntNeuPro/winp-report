In this section we provide the summary reports of the physics-related
working groups.  These working groups convened in the morning of
February 5, 2015 to discuss the outstanding physics questions in neutrino
physics, with emphasis on those that can be addressed within the next
decade.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Sterile Neutrinos
  \item Three Neutrino Mixing
