\section{Sterile Neutrinos}
\label{sec:Sterile}

Sterile neutrinos appear in nearly every possible mechanism to explain neutrino mass, which in itself has been established by neutrino oscillations of three active neutrinos. Given that neutrino mass so far has been the only evidence for physics beyond the Standard Model found in particle physics, in contrast to astrophysical evidence for dark matter and dark energy, this should make the quest for understanding the origin of neutrino mass one of the priorities of the field. 

Apart from these theoretical considerations, there have been persistent anomalies, observed in electron neutrino appearance and electron neutrino disappearance (For the disappearance channel neutrino and antineutrino oscillation probabilities are equal assuming CPT invariance and therefor we make no distinction in the remainder of the document.), which in combination can be interpreted as evidence for one or several sterile neutrinos at around a mass of 1~eV and with oscillation amplitudes as large as 5-10\%. At the same time, the lack of observations of muon neutrino disappearance at the relevant L/E values creates a significant tension in global fits. Currently, no phenomenological models are known that provide a better fit to the global data than sterile neutrinos. It therefore seems justified to use sterile neutrino oscillations as a phenomenological proxy for considering the required experimental capabilities to resolve these anomalies. In the event that the existence of sterile neutrinos is not the source of these anomalies, experiments optimized to eV-scale oscillations can be expected to also have good sensitivity to probe other new physics scenarios. 

During the Snowmass process and P5 deliberations, many different experimental approaches to this problem have been proposed and some have been studied in quite some detail and some even have already reached the prototype stage. Sterile neutrino searches build on detection techniques developed for rare event searches and low-energy neutrinos from reactors and the sun, allowing for efficient experiment deployment at modest cost in some cases.  Among the many proposed experimental approaches, electron neutrino disappearance searches using radioactive sources and reactors and electron neutrino appearance searches outside the Fermilab short baseline program seem to fit well within the scope of an intermediate neutrino program. Thus, a modest investment into sterile neutrino searches has the potential to discover a particle not predicted in the Standard Model for the first time since the Standard Model was formulated. This would be a paradigm-shifting discovery opening up vistas on an entirely new continent of possibilities. The U.S. community is well poised to play a leadership role and to have a vibrant program in this field. 

In the somewhat longer term, and in particular in anticipation of a potential discovery of sterile neutrinos, directed R\&D towards novel detector technologies and neutrino sources also would fit the boundary conditions of an intermediate neutrino program. 

The working group's consensus can be summarized in the following five recommendations:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Sterile neutrinos are well motivated in many extensions of the Standard Model.   Persistent experimental anomalies have focused attention on the eV mass scale.  This makes sterile neutrinos the subject of potentially high-reward experiments.  Therefore, the P5 Planning Report recommends a targeted set of short-term, small-scale experiments.}
\item{Direct tests of existing anomalies should seek to demonstrate the sterile neutrino's oscillatory nature via signatures in energy and baseline.}
\item{Experiments designed to test both the $\nu_{\mu}$ to $\nu_e$ appearance and $\nu_e$ disappearance channels are needed.  We must ensure that any pion decay beam program has optimized $\nu_{\mu}$ disappearance sensitivity.}
\item{Below the \$5M level, individual experiments can do impactful oscillation physics results within the WINP time constraints.  In the \$5-10M range, several proposed efforts have the potential to provide extensive coverage of the suggested oscillation parameter space.}
\item{Short-term investment in detector and source R\&D towards future sterile oscillation experiments could reduce risk, lead to long-term cost savings, and provide the foundation for precision measurements in the case of observation of sterile neutrino oscillations.}
\end{enumerate}
